# [Project 1: Are golfers focused on the right metrics?](https://github.com/nicolehayashi/golfmetrics/blob/master/golfmetrics.ipynb)
* Set of three experiments to determine if there was any statistical evidence that proved a player's greens in regulation percentage, driving accuracy percentage and scrambling percentage significantly impacted a golfer's score

# [Project 2: Who will win the 2020 Masters?](https://github.com/nicolehayashi/masterswinner/blob/master/2020masterswinner.ipynb)
* This is my first attempt at predicting the winner of the 2020 Masters, a major professional golf tournament
* Analyzed past Masters winners and lowest (best) scoring players over time
* Created a multivariate linear regression model to predict who is most likely to win the 2020 Masters (November 12-15, 2020)
